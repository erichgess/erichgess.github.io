It has been quite a long time since my last blog post.  Quite a lot has happened in that time.  I moved from San Diego to Chicago.  I got a new job and now the CTO for a small start up company out in Chicago.  I have switched off of Windows development to Linux development.  I have gone though doing my work on a Windows box, to a Linux box, and now I'm on a MacBook.  I have been doing a lot of learning about Cassandra, Python, Clojure, and Spark.  I have been learning about data science and machine learning.

It's been an exciting and challenging year for me.

I also realized that I miss writing posts (though I only did a few) which help me organize my thoughts and enforce new things which I have learned.

So, now I'll be kicking that learning off again.
