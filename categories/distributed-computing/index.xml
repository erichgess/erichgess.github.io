Which I am building because it will help me learn and explore topics in distributed computing independent of work.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been slowly working on it when I get a chance and have put together a very basic prototype: https://github.com/erichgess/OdinPrototype
This prototype is some hacking I did over a few, very spread out days, to try out some concepts. It has a very simple agent, which reads %CPU used and sends a message to a receiver.</description></item><item><title>Odin - Learning Distributed Computing</title><link>http://example.org/posts/2014-03-07-odin-learning-distributed-computing/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Mar 2014 22:39:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/posts/2014-03-07-odin-learning-distributed-computing/</guid><description>Over the last two years, I&amp;rsquo;ve really become interested in distributed computing and things like big data. My interest in these topics grew in coincidence with my falling in love with F#. I do a lot of different projects at work and not all of them involve any of those three topics. So, to provide a motive for learning more about distributed computing and sharpening my F# skills I have decided to start working on a small side project (currently, by myself but several friends are interested).</description></item></channel></rss>
