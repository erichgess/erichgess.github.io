  <div class="entry-content"><p>Chapter 2 covers the efficient implementation of stack and binary search 
trees when your data structures
must be immutable.  This chapter wound up being a lot of fun to work on because
it helped me focus a lot on how to approach structuring my F# code and start
laying the foundation for how to approach building elegant F# code.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of my favorite things to do in F# is pipe functions together.  I like the elegant flow that the
semantics visualizes and the fact that it removes the need for intermediate variables.  Given that,
one of the minor, but consistent, annoyances I’ve had is when piping a DU type which generally need
to be piped into a pattern match expression.  This is annoying because the <code>match</code> expression doesn’t
lend itself to piping which has meant that my nice workflow needs to be broken up with an intermediate
variable that can be used in the <code>match</code> expression.</p>

<p>Looking at some old code I wrote, I just realized something that is probably pretty obvious to every
experienced F# programmer out there.  The <code>function</code> expression actually does exactly what <code>match</code> does
but it creates a function and that’s exactly what I’ve been wanting this whole time!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As a follow up to my post about Zippers for lists and binary trees, I wanted to create a zipper for
a slightly more complex data structure.  The Rose Tree is a tree structure where the number of
branches a node may have is variable.  An example of a rose tree would be the directory structure
on your computer:  each directory may contain 0 or more sub directories which, in turn, may contain
addition subdirectories.  With this example in mind, the zipper is analagous to you moving through
your computers file system:  starting at the root directory and using <code>cd</code> to move down a branch
and <code>cd ..</code> to move back.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the coolest things about working with F# (and other ML languages) is the
incredibly elegant way that mathematics intersects with programming, to inform
powerful tools for our toolbox.  Algebraic Data Types (ADTs) are the source of a
large amount of this mathematical invention.  Recently, I’ve been exploring the
algebra and calculus of types and what happens when you take the derivative
of a type.</p>

<p>Zippers are a type pattern which provide a functional way to interact with and transform data structures:  linked lists,
binary trees, rose trees, etc.  The Zipper is a type with a set of functions that create a cursor which moved through a
data structure, much like you move through your computers file directory tree, and can be used to modify the data
structure.  They’re also a really cool demonstration of the intersection between programming and higher math, in this
case: derivatives.</p>

<p>In this blog post, I will explain both the mechanics of the Zipper type and the mathematics of the Zipper.  First,
I’ll explain the list Zipper:  how to make one in F# and what can be done with it.  Second, the list zipper will be used
as the basis for teaching how to take the derivative of an Algebraic Data Type (ADT).  Finally, the derivative
operation will be usd to create a Zipper for the binary tree.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>While visiting San Diego, for some much needed time off from work, I had a fantastic evening hanging out my friend Steve Bjorg and his family.  As the bookend to the evening, Steve and I sat down and had chatted about reading books.  It started as merely a random topic on which to build an enjoyable conversation, but quickly morphed into a discussion about how to represent knowledge.</p>

<p>The driver behind our discussion was an exploration of my inability to read technical books on a Kindle or computer.  The reason I dislike reading technical books on devices is because they don’t allow me to do my prefered method of navigation.  When I’m reading a technical book, there are two possible reasons that are making me read:  1. to solve a specific problem that I am having or 2. to find something which sparks my interest and passion and causes me to explore and experiment.  For example, I’ve been learning Clojure, my main resource for that as been one of the O’Reilly books on Clojure.  I have the Clojure basics down, so now what I do is flip through the book quickly until I see a diagram, image, or something which catches my attention, at which point I stop and start reading the context.  So the question Steve and I began exploring was:  can you represent the contents of a large complex technical manual, online, in a way which allows a reader to guide themselves through the entire subject matter in a way which only requires a glance to find what is important.</p>

<p>The problem with doing this sequential flip through of online documentation is that online documenation is not sequential; it is a heirarchical tree or maybe even a directed graph.  Each section linking to children which dive in to more detail about each topic covered in the parent section or linking over to related topics.  When your book is a choose your own adventure tree, how can you flip through it sequentially while still keeping context?  Our first idea was to make this tree a sequence by enumerating it with a breadth first search.  Our guess here is that a breadth first search will keep some level of connection between parent and children topics and allow the reader to build an over laying context to keep things reasonable.</p>

<p>My own personal vision of what this would become is something like a cartoon map of an amusement park.  Ideally, a wordless, visual guide which represents the broad strokes of what is in the manual while cartooonishly exagerating the features of interest.  In other words, and adventurer’s map:  pointing out where there be dragons, and trolls, and krakens, and dungeons.  So a user can look at it, find something which looks fascinating instantly, and diving into the full granular details and context to learn.</p>

<p>This is all about providing a way for someone who already knows the basics of a topic to keep themselves diving further and further into the ocean.  Basically, it’s a carrot to dangle in front of people to motivate them to learn your software by showing them adventures they can have.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It has been quite a long time since my last blog post.  Quite a lot has happened in that time.  I moved from San Diego to Chicago.  I got a new job and now the CTO for a small start up company out in Chicago.  I have switched off of Windows development to Linux development.  I have gone though doing my work on a Windows box, to a Linux box, and now I’m on a MacBook.  I have been doing a lot of learning about Cassandra, Python, Clojure, and Spark.  I have been learning about data science and machine learning.</p>

<p>It’s been an exciting and challenging year for me.</p>

<p>I also realized that I miss writing posts (though I only did a few) which help me organize my thoughts and enforce new things which I have learned.</p>

<p>So, now I’ll be kicking that learning off again.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In Part 3 of this Tutorial, I talked a little about erased types and how the types we generate are actually built on top of a <code>obj</code>.  Previously, I just used a plan <code>obj</code> type and cast an integer to and from the <code>obj</code> types.</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="fsharp"><span class="line"><span class="nc">InvokeCode</span><span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="k">fun</span> <span class="n">args</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="o">&lt;@@</span> <span class="mi">0</span> <span class="o">:&gt;</span> <span class="n">obj</span> <span class="o">@@&gt;))</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Using just the basic <code>obj</code> works well enough for a very simple generated type (like the simple integer from part 3).  However, it becomes a bit of a mess when you want to make anything complicated.</p>

<p>In this part, we will update our Type Provider to use a more advanced type as our base type.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In the last tutorial, we built a simple type named <code>Hello</code> which had some static members.  In this tutorial, we’ll expand our <code>Hello</code> type to include a constructor, an instance property, and an instance method.  Adding these will allow us to create instances of <code>Hello</code> using the <code>new</code> operator:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="fsharp"><span class="line"><span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nc">Hello</span><span class="bp">()</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>We’ll also make <code>Hello</code> store some data, that means our type providers will be one step closer to awesome.  Also, one step closer to being an effective means of interacting with structured data sources.</p>

<p>The full code for what we make in this part will be at the end of this post.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In Part 1 of this series, I briefly explained what a Type Provider was and some of the main concepts which you would need to know.  In Part 2, I am going to build a very simple Type Provider.  The purpose of Part 2 is to cover the basics of developing Type Providers, how to test them with F# Interactive, and the support tools which make developing Type Providers easy.</p>

<p>I will make a Type Provider which generates a single type named “Hello”.  At first it will just have a static property which returns the string <code>"World"</code>.  Then I will add a static method which takes no parameters.  Finally, I will add a static method which takes a parameter.
