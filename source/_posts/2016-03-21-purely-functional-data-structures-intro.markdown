In order to improve my functional programming skills and refresh my memory
re algorithms, I'm reading _Purely Functional Data Structures_ by Chris
Okasaki.  To help me beef up my skills, particularly with F#, I'm also
converting all of the data structures into F#.  I'll be recording all of this
in a series of blog posts.

This series will begin with Chapter 2, since Chapter 1 is just an introduction.
