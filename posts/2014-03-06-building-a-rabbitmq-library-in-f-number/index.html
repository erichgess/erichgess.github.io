<div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links nested-img mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>I&rsquo;ve been doing a lot of experimenting with F# and distributed computing via messaging. As evidenced by my previous, I&rsquo;m using RabbitMQ as my messaging platform, for a couple of reasons: it&rsquo;s easy to use, it&rsquo;s free and open source, and I might decide to switch to RabbitMQ at work. I&rsquo;ve been having a lot of fun experimenting with RabbitMQ and F#. However, I spend a lot of my time just writing and copy/pasting the boilerplate code needed to configure the RabbitMQ client libraries, add the fact that the .Net client library is written for C#, and you get a constant block of boring work. So, purely for fun and profit, I&rsquo;m going to write a quick F# wrapper. The purpose of it being to let me very quickly setup RabbitMQ and, just as importantly, work with RabbitMQ in a manner that better fits F#.</p>
<h2 id=design>Design</h2>
<p>I want to use this as an opportuntity to practice all of my engineering skills. So, I&rsquo;m going to start by defining the problem I want to solve, the scope of work, and then the design itself. For the problem: I will try to understand what my needs are, right now, and predict what they will be in the future. For the scope of work: RabbitMQ has a lot of stuff, so I will use the definition of the problem to decide how much of the RabbitMQ framework I will expose with my wrapper. The design: this is when I will figure out how I want to use this library and how to make it fit the F#/functional paradigm. I will do all of this, before I start writing any code!</p>
<h4 id=the-problems>The Problem(s)</h4>
<p>Right now, I have two problems when I&rsquo;m trying to do a messaging experiment in F#:</p>
<ol>
<li>I have to rewrite the RabbitMQ setup code every time I make a new endpoint.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s OO/C# focused design doesn&rsquo;t fit very well with F#. It works, but, I think, it will be better if it&rsquo;s functional.</li>
<li>Long term, I&rsquo;d like to make up a simple RabbitMQ F# Client library which anyone could use.</li>
</ol>
<p>I threw number 3 on there, not because it is a problem I am trying to solve right now, but because this something which could contribute to the F# community. By keeping this in mind as a long term goal, it will help me write my solution so that it is easy to expand.</p>
<h4 id=the-scope>The Scope</h4>
<p>For scope, I&rsquo;ll look at the first two problems and ignore the third. Problem 2 shouldn&rsquo;t impact the scope very much, as it&rsquo;s really a restriction on my design: make the design fit the functional paradigm. Problem 1 definitely can impact the scope of work: there is a lot to RabbitMQ and doing a full client implementation in F# would be a LOT of work. To define the scope of work I am going to do, I&rsquo;ll focus on explicitly writing out my needs and then only do the amount of work necessary to meet those needs.</p>
<h5 id=problem-1-needs>Problem 1 Needs</h5>
<p>I am doing very little with RabbitMQ in my experiments. I am not using subjects, or fan-out exchanges, or anything; except making queues, publishing messages to the queue, and reading from the queue. The messages, for this post, will also just be simple text messages, so no serialization/deserialization. So this is all I need (in version 1 :) ):</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a queue on a RabbitMQ server</li>
<li>Publish a message to a specific queue</li>
<li>Read messages from a specific queue</li>
<li>Messages are just text messages</li>
</ol>
<p>Easy Enough! My first version of the RabbitMQ F# client will only do those 3 things.</p>
<h5 id=problem-2-needs>Problem 2 Needs</h5>
<p>This is purely aesthetic. The more I worke in F#, the more I find writing up classes and implementing interfaces to feel a bit &ldquo;ehhh&rdquo;. So I want to make the way a developer uses and interacts with RabbitMQ to be more functional. This is a bit more vague than I&rsquo;d like, because this will require a bit more learning on my part; which is why I put it here!</p>
<h5 id=scope>Scope</h5>
<p>At the end of all of this, my library will do just provide these three features:</p>
<ol>
<li>Connect to or create a specified queue on a RabbitMQ server</li>
<li>Provide a way to publish messages to the queue</li>
<li>Provide a way to read messages from the queue</li>
</ol>
<p>Behind the scenes it will do whatever setup/teardown is needed to get those 3 features to work.</p>
<h4 id=the-design>The Design</h4>
<p>The design needs to be more functional than OO, so that it fits better with the general aesthetic flow of writing F#. Being new to functional design, I&rsquo;ll start with the <a href=http://simontcousins.azurewebsites.net/manifesto/>NOOO Manifesto</a> as my guide:</p>
<ul>
<li>Functions and Types over classes</li>
<li>Purity over mutability</li>
<li>Composition over inheritance</li>
<li>Higher-order functions over method dispatch</li>
<li>Options over nulls</li>
</ul>
<p>In my next post, I&rsquo;ll start the actual implementation of my library.</p>
